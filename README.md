# Conclusion

The Synthetic Banking Dataset Project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to assess customer risk and predict loan default outcomes using realistic, privacy-safe data. By generating a comprehensive synthetic dataset that mirrors real-world banking behavior, we were able to explore key financial indicators such as credit score, income levels, EMI-to-income ratio, late payments, and existing liabilities.

Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using algorithms like Random Forestthe project highlights how predictive models can support informed lending decisions. The models achieved strong performance metrics, indicating their effectiveness in identifying high-risk customers and reducing potential loan defaults.

SHAP explainability provided valuable insights into the factors that influence customer risk, making the solution transparent and useful for banking professionals.

Overall, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow—from dataset creation to model deployment—making it a practical and scalable solution for credit risk analysis while ensuring data privacy through synthetic data generation.
